<div class= "about"> <h1> About Me:</h1> Hi, my name is Phil! I am a third year Communications student majoring in marketing and minoring in media at Mssey University. Designing this website has been an absolutle learning curve, but this is exactly why i decided to do it. <br> I have 0 experience with photoshop let alone coding! But it seems to be a very useful skill. All my studies so far have been 90% theoretical. The three pictures above is part of the 10% of some form of design, this was for my PR class in 2019 in which we were creating for VSA( Volunteer Service Abroad), avenues in which their organisation could explore in order to attract more of their target audience to volunteer for them. This is a selcetion of three advertsing campaigns i created with some online eitor as i dont have photoshop haha. Below you will find pictures about what i do as a part-time job and some of my hobbies as im sure you dont want to read my bussiness eassys so lets look at some pictures instead!
